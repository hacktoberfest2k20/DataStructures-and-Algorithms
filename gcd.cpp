\* program to calculate gcd (greatest common divisor) of two numbers a and b
If we subtract smaller number from larger (we reduce larger number), GCD doesnâ€™t change. 
So if we keep subtracting repeatedly the larger of two, we end up with GCD.
Now instead of subtraction, if we divide smaller number, the algorithm stops when we find remainder 0.

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
       
ll gcd(ll a,ll b){
     if(b==0) return a;  //base case
     return gcd(b,a%b);     
}
        
int main(void)
{
    ll a,b;
    cin>>a>>b;
    cout<<gcd(a,b)<<endl;
    return 0;
}
